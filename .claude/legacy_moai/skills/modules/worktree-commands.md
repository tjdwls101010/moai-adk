## Quick Reference (30 seconds)

Command Categories:
- Creation: `new` - Create isolated worktree
- Navigation: `list`, `switch`, `go` - Browse and navigate
- Management: `sync`, `remove`, `clean` - Maintain worktrees
- Status: `status` - Check worktree state
- Configuration: `config` - Manage settings

Quick Start:
```bash
moai-worktree new SPEC-001 "User Authentication"
moai-worktree switch SPEC-001
# or: eval $(moai-worktree go SPEC-001)
```

---

## Core Commands

### `moai-worktree new` - Create Worktree

Create a new isolated Git worktree for SPEC development.

Syntax:
```bash
moai-worktree new <spec-id> [description] [options]
```

Arguments:
- `<spec-id>`: SPEC identifier (e.g., SPEC-001, SPEC-AUTH-001)
- `[description]`: Optional description for the worktree

Options:
- `--branch <branch-name>`: Create specific branch instead of auto-generated
- `--base <branch>`: Base branch for new worktree (default: main)
- `--template <template>`: Use predefined template
- `--shallow`: Create shallow clone for faster setup
- `--depth <number>`: Clone depth for shallow clone
- `--force`: Force creation even if worktree exists

Examples:
```bash
# Basic worktree creation
moai-worktree new SPEC-001 "User Authentication System"

# Custom branch name
moai-worktree new SPEC-002 "Payment Integration" --branch feature/payment-gateway

# From develop branch
moai-worktree new SPEC-003 "API Refactoring" --base develop

# Using template
moai-worktree new SPEC-004 "Frontend Overhaul" --template frontend

# Fast creation with shallow clone
moai-worktree new SPEC-005 "Bug Fixes" --shallow --depth 1
```

Auto-Generated Branch Pattern:
- Default: `feature/SPEC-{ID}-{description-kebab-case}`
- Example: `SPEC-001` → `feature/SPEC-001-user-authentication`

Output:
```bash
 Created worktree: SPEC-001
 Branch: feature/SPEC-001-user-authentication
 Path: /Users/goos/worktrees/MoAI-ADK/SPEC-001
 Registered in: /Users/goos/worktrees/MoAI-ADK/.moai-worktree-registry.json

Next steps:
1. Switch to worktree: moai-worktree switch SPEC-001
2. Or use shell eval: eval $(moai-worktree go SPEC-001)
```

---

### `moai-worktree list` - List Worktrees

Display all registered worktrees with their status and metadata.

Syntax:
```bash
moai-worktree list [options]
```

Options:
- `--format <format>`: Output format (table, json, csv)
- `--status <status>`: Filter by status (active, merged, stale)
- `--sort <field>`: Sort by field (name, created, modified, status)
- `--reverse`: Reverse sort order
- `--verbose`: Show detailed information

Examples:
```bash
# Table format (default)
moai-worktree list

# JSON output for scripting
moai-worktree list --format json

# Show only active worktrees
moai-worktree list --status active

# Sort by creation date
moai-worktree list --sort created

# Detailed view
moai-worktree list --verbose
```

Table Output:
```bash

 ID Description Path Status Last Sync 

 SPEC-001 User Authentication System /worktrees/MoAI-ADK/ active 2h ago 
 SPEC-002 Payment Integration /worktrees/MoAI-ADK/ active 1d ago 
 SPEC-003 API Refactoring /worktrees/MoAI-ADK/ merged 3d ago 

```

JSON Output:
```json
{
 "worktrees": [
 {
 "id": "SPEC-001",
 "description": "User Authentication System",
 "path": "/Users/goos/worktrees/MoAI-ADK/SPEC-001",
 "branch": "feature/SPEC-001-user-auth",

### `moai-worktree switch` - Switch to Worktree

Change current working directory to the specified worktree.

Syntax:
```bash
moai-worktree switch <spec-id> [options]
```

Arguments:
- `<spec-id>`: Target worktree identifier

Options:
- `--auto-sync`: Automatically sync before switching
- `--force`: Force switch even with uncommitted changes
- `--new-terminal`: Open in new terminal window

Examples:

 Current directory: /Users/goos/worktrees/MoAI-ADK/SPEC-001
 Branch: feature/SPEC-001-user-auth
 Status: 5 commits ahead of main
```

---

### `moai-worktree go` - Get Worktree Path

Output the `cd` command for shell integration.

Syntax:
```bash
moai-worktree go <spec-id> [options]
```

Arguments:
- `<spec-id>`: Target worktree identifier

Options:
- `--absolute`: Show absolute path
- `--relative`: Show relative path from current directory
- `--export`: Export as environment variable

Examples:
```bash
# Standard usage (shell eval)

# With --export
export WORKTREE_PATH="/Users/goos/worktrees/MoAI-ADK/SPEC-001"
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
```

## Management Commands

### `moai-worktree sync` - Synchronize Worktree

Synchronize worktree with its base branch.

Syntax:
```bash
moai-worktree sync <spec-id> [options]
```

Arguments:
- `<spec-id>`: Worktree identifier (or `--all` for all worktrees)

Options:
- `--auto-resolve`: Automatically resolve simple conflicts
- `--interactive`: Interactive conflict resolution
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be synced without doing it
- `--force`: Force sync even with uncommitted changes
- `--include <pattern>`: Include only specific files
- `--exclude <pattern>`: Exclude specific files

Examples:
```bash
# Sync specific worktree
moai-worktree sync SPEC-001

# Sync all worktrees
moai-worktree sync --all

# Interactive conflict resolution
moai-worktree sync SPEC-001 --interactive

# Dry run to preview changes
moai-worktree sync SPEC-001 --dry-run

# Include only source files
moai-worktree sync SPEC-001 --include "src/"

# Exclude build artifacts
moai-worktree sync SPEC-001 --exclude "node_modules/" --exclude "dist/"
```

Conflict Resolution Options:

When conflicts are detected:
```bash
Conflict detected in src/auth.py
Choose resolution:
1) Keep worktree version (current)
2) Accept base branch version
3) Open merge tool
4) Skip this file
5) Abort sync

Choice [1-5]:
```

Output:
```bash
 Syncing SPEC-001 with main branch
 Fetching latest changes...
 5 new commits in main branch
 Merging changes into feature/SPEC-001-user-auth
 Sync completed successfully
 Worktree is now up-to-date
```

---

### Batch Synchronization: `sync --all --auto-resolve`

When developing multiple SPECs in parallel, synchronizing each worktree individually is cumbersome. The `moai-worktree sync --all --auto-resolve` command iterates through all active worktrees in the registry and applies the latest changes from the main branch.

How it works:
1. Queries all active worktrees from the registry
2. Performs git merge or git rebase from main branch for each worktree
3. With `--auto-resolve`: Automatically resolves simple conflicts (different regions of same file)
4. Complex conflicts: Skips that worktree and notifies user of manual intervention needed

Use cases:
- After large-scale refactoring or common library updates merged to main branch
- Daily routine before starting work
- Weekly maintenance to keep all worktrees up to date

Benefits:
- Distributes potential merge conflicts across regular syncs
- Prevents large conflict accumulation at final merge time
- Maintains consistency across parallel SPEC development

Examples:
```bash
# Sync all worktrees with auto-resolve
moai-worktree sync --all --auto-resolve

# Daily best practice
moai-worktree status          # Check all worktree states
moai-worktree sync --all      # Sync all (manual conflict resolution)
```

Output:
```bash
 Batch sync initiated for 3 active worktrees

 Syncing SPEC-001...
  Fetching latest changes from main...
  3 new commits merged
  Sync completed

 Syncing SPEC-002...
  Fetching latest changes from main...
  No new commits
  Already up-to-date

 Syncing SPEC-003...
  Fetching latest changes from main...
  Conflict detected in src/config.py
  Auto-resolve: Applied (different regions)
  Sync completed

 Batch sync completed: 3/3 worktrees synchronized
```

### `moai-worktree remove` - Remove Worktree

Remove a worktree and clean up its registration.

Syntax:
```bash
moai-worktree remove <spec-id> [options]
```

Arguments:
- `<spec-id>`: Worktree identifier to remove

Options:
- `--force`: Force removal without confirmation
- `--keep-branch`: Keep the branch after removing worktree
- `--backup`: Create backup before removal
- `--dry-run`: Show what would be removed without doing it
